description: This was an analysis of competitive hospital facilities within 15 miles of the client's locations. KPIs for competitors were compared on a localized basis to understand whether the client hospitals were performing at or above the level of similar facilities in their individual trade areas. The analysis was used to assess the quality of a hospital system's portfolio for an investment decision.
