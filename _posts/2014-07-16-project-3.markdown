description: Created a custom yield screener for high-yield bonds by recalculating target yields based on custom exit dates. This was used by an investment group for idea generation by understanding the most likely actual yield to refinancing/call vs. YTM or YTW shown in the static index. This was an R program that was fed by an investment vendor's API, and stored in a cloud database for display to analysts.
