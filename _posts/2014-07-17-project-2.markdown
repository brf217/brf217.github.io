description: Developed a natural gas supply and demand time-series econometric model using demand drivers from EIA and NOAA, as well as custom supply forecasts from well-level production data. Production data (type-curves) from about 2.5mm individual wells are aggregated and forecast through custom Python code. This model has backed numerous successful macro trades.
