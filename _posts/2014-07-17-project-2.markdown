description: Developed a natural gas supply and demand time-series econometric model using demand actuals from EIA and NOAA, as well as custom supply forecasts from well-level production data. Production data (type-curves) from about 2.5mm indivdual wells aggregated and forecasted through custom Python code, and rolled up to the shale play level to select the most profitable producers in those areas.
