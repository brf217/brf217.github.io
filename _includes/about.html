        <p>I am a data scientist with deep domain expertise in the field of finance and investing. Given
        my various roles, I have developed some expertise in the full-cycle of projects including the 
        creation of source data feeds and ETL pipelines, as well as the management of data warehouses
        to store my source data.</p>

        <p>My formal education is a B.A. in Economics and an M.S. in Finance, but through a demanding career in 
          consulting I started to understand the power of automation, leading me to become a self-taught
          Python, SQL, and R developer. Initially I did this to become more efficient on analytics projects, however, I ended up loving 
          the process so much I went into full-time data science work in 2016.</p>
