        <p>I am a data scientist with deep domain expertise in the field of finance and investing. Given
        my various professional roles, I've developed expertise in the full-cycle of analytics projects including the 
        creation of source data feeds and ETL pipelines, management of data warehouses, and visual development in BI tools.
        Creating models is fun, but I enjoy creating a clean, automated process to collect and catalog the necessary data the most.</p>

        <p>My formal education is a B.A. in Economics and an M.S. in Finance, but through a career in 
          consulting, I started to understand the power of automated data collection and processing to make business decisions.
          This led me to become a self-taught Python, SQL, and R developer. Initially I did this to become more efficient on analytics projects,
          however, I ended up loving the process so much I went into full-time data science work in 2016.</p>
