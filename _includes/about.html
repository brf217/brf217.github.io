        <p>I am a data scientist with deep domain knowledge in finance. Given
        my practical experience with clients in my former management consulting role, and my current data science career, I've developed expertise in the full-cycle of analytics projects. This includes everything from
        gathering requirements, to creation of source data feeds/ETL pipelines, management of data warehouses, visual development in BI tools, and predictive modeling when needed.</p>
     
      <p>My formal education is a B.A. in Economics from NYU and an M.S. in Finance from the University of Colorado.
         I began programming here and there in 2007 to automate a few repetitive Excel tasks, however, I ended up loving the process so much over time, I went into full-time data science work in 2016.</p>
      
      <p>Mostly, I enjoy creating a clean, automated process to give my team powerful decisionmaking capabilities.</p>
