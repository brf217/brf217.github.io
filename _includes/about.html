              <p class = "about">I've been a professional data scientist since 2016, with deep experience in finance/investing. I started my career in management consulting, and given that I 
                loved the technical side projects, I eventually started working toward an engineering-based role.</p>  
                
               <p class = "about"> I started programming seriously in 2012 to automate a few repetitive Excel and database tasks, and enjoyed the process so much, I ended up here.</p> 
      
              <p class = "about">A typical project for me includes everything from gathering requirements, coding source data feeds/ETL pipelines, management of data warehouses, development in BI tools,
                predictive modeling, and presenting results. I do not rely on a data engineer to wrangle my source data.</p>
           
            <p class = "about">My formal education is a B.A. in Economics from New York University and an M.S. in Finance from the University of Colorado. I add to my technical knowledge 
              through online courses or projects requiring new tools.</p>
