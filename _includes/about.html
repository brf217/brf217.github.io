              <p class = "about">I've been a professional data scientist since 2016. My domain experience is mostly in finance and SaaS products. I started my career in management consulting, but
                started moving toward an engineering-based role as that is what I enjoyed from my project work.</p>  
                
               <p class = "about"> I started programming seriously in 2012 to automate a few repetitive Excel and database tasks, and enjoyed the process so much, I ended up here.</p> 
      
              <p class = "about">A typical project for me includes everything from gathering requirements, coding source data feeds/ETL pipelines, management of data warehouses, development in BI tools,
                predictive modeling, and presenting results. I have not always had access to a data engineering team, so a decent amount of my work falls into that category.</p>
           
            <p class = "about">My formal education is a B.A. in Economics from New York University and an M.S. in Finance from the University of Colorado. I regularly add to my technical knowledge 
              through online courses or exploring in new tools.</p>
