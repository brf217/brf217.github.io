        <p>I am a data scientist with deep domain knowledge in finance and operations. Given
        my various professional roles, I've developed expertise in the full-cycle of analytics projects including the 
        creation of source data feeds/ETL pipelines, management of data warehouses, visual development in BI tools, and predictive modeling.

        <p>My formal education is a B.A. in Economics and an M.S. in Finance, but through a career in 
          consulting, I started to understand the power of automated data collection and processing to make business decisions.
          Initially I began programming to become more efficient on analytics projects,
          however, I ended up loving the process so much I went into full-time data science work in 2016.</p>

         <p>Mostly, I enjoy creating a clean, automated process to give my team new capabilities using data they were not able to collect
         efficiently before.</p>
